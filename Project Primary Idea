OOP project idea: Family members' medical care system
1. Will take notes on how many members and who are in a medical situation.
2. Make individual notes on which medicine for whom and the medicine schedule.
3. Take notes on the whole treatment plan.
4. Will notify when it will be time for a medicine.(Need to learn to make a clock for it.)
5. Keep track of medicine assumption.
6. Each medicine of a member will have the purpose of it noted with it.
